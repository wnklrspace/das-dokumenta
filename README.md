# Dokumenta - The Smart Way to Collaborate on Documents

## Abstract

This web application allows users to collaborate live on PDF documents. Users can upload documents and edit, resolve and share comments with others in real-time.

## Getting started

### Preparations:

1. Start Docker Desktop

2. Run in Terminal:

```
docker compose up
```

### Where to open

Open your browser and visit:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### How to log in

- Username: `Flo`
- Password: `tins`

### Notes on usage

- If you want to test the app with multiple users, please use another user. Don't log in with the same account twice, this could lead to some unwanted side effects. The password is always `tins`. Available usernames are:
  `Kobi, Simon, Nico`

- We mainly tested the application with Chrome, so please use this browser for the best performance.

- When using the mobile breakpoint in your browser, have in mind that your own mouse cursor will not be visible. We recommend using the mobile device simulator in your browser (chrome dev tools) where you can use a tap indicator.

Have fun!
